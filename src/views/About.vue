        TrapScan is a mobile web application designed by conservation
        volunteers to simplify their record keeping and reporting workload.

            Commitment to Volunteers
          </v-expansion-panel-header>
          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            Our primary mission is to make the recording and viewing of trap activity
            easy and accessible. This includes welcoming general members
            of public get involved by letting trappers know of catches they see,
            without needing to create an account.
            <br />
            <br />We want to minimise the time it takes to record data to free up more
            time for volunteers to do the real work that makes a difference. By
            making it easier we hope to increase how much data is captured,
            therefore making the bigger picture more clear. The more we know about
            what's happening and the results of our efforts, the more we can learn
            from each other and make better decisions we can make as a nation.
            <br />
            <br />We want everyone to be able to see these results though, not just the
            data gurus tucked away in offices. That's why we display this data in
            a clear and simple way. We hope that the work will become more
            engaging if the volunteers can track their efforts and view progress
            without having to wrestle with spreadsheets and file management.

            Commitment to Project Coordinators
          </v-expansion-panel-header>
          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            Our second mission is to help project coordinators get more done in
            less time by removing some of their common pain points and providing
            tooling to make their life easier.
            <br />
            <br />In future plan to build in volunteer relationship and asset management
            features, and to improve the project onboarding and offboarding
            experiences for both parties.
            <br />
            <br />We believe that volunteer project coordinators are modern day heroes
            and without them we'd have no chance at saving our species from the
            grizzly demise they face. For that we want to repay their efforts by
            catering directly to them, so if you are a project coordinator and
            have some ideas, please reach out :)

            Our native wildlife and pest problems
          </v-expansion-panel-header>
          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            Aotearoa New Zealand was isolated for 80 million years and was the
            last place on earth that primates set foot. Flora and fauna evolved in
            a very curious and unique way with the absence of predatory mammals.
            Many of our species are only found here which makes them
            internationally significant and important to protect.
            <br />
            <br />The introduction of mammalian pests with the arrival of humans led to
            the extinction of over 65 of our most treasured species and to this
            day we are still losing the battle...
